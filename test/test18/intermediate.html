  <p>President Joe Biden mourned the killing of at least 19 children and two
    teachers in a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school on Tuesday,
    decrying their deaths as senseless and demanding action to try to curb the
    violence.</p>
  <p>“I hoped, when I became president, I would not have to do this again,”
    Biden said at the White House, in sometimes halting, emotional remarks.
    “Another massacre in Uvalde, Texas. An elementary school. Beautiful,
    innocent second, third and fourth graders.”</p>
  <p>“As a nation,” he said, “we have to ask: When are we going to stand up to
    the gun lobby? When are we going to do what we know in our gut needs to be
    done?”</p>

  <p>Tuesday’s massacre at Robb Elementary School is the latest in a string of
    mass shootings that have rocked the country. Just 10 days ago, a gunman in
    Buffalo, New York, opened fire at a supermarket, killing 10 people in a
    racist attack.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The attack in Uvalde, which is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of San
    Antonio, is the deadliest US school shooting since a gunman killed 26
    people, most of them first graders, at Sandy Hook elementary school in
    Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.</p>

  <p>The shooter, an 18-year-old, was killed Tuesday by responding officers.
    Texas State Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat from the region, said in an
    MSNBC interview that the man had bought his weapons legally on or shortly
    after his 18th birthday.</p>

  <p>Across the US, anger overflowed among Americans who have long demanded, to
    no avail, that federal lawmakers do anything to prevent gunmen from
    perpetrating horrific violence, especially against children. After the Sandy
    Hook slayings, President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats sought to pass
    new gun-control measures only to see the legislation blocked by Republicans,
    who have suffered no electoral consequences for their opposition to even
    modest restrictions on civilian weaponry.</p>

  <p>The coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, channeled the rage,
    setting aside pregame remarks about his team’s playoff matchup with the
    Dallas Mavericks Tuesday evening to instead excoriate congressional
    Republicans for their intransigence. Kerr’s remarks had been viewed nearly
    24 million times on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.</p>
  <p>“Any basketball questions don’t matter,” Kerr said, recounting the
    shootings in Uvalde, Buffalo and elsewhere. “When are we going to do
    something?” he said, raising his voice and pounding his hand on a table.</p>

  <p>He called out Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell by name, accusing
    him and his party of fighting gun control only in order to hold onto
    power.</p>
  <p>“All of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence in school
    shootings and supermarket shootings, I ask you: are you going to put your
    own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and
    our churchgoers?” Kerr said. “Because that’s what it looks like.”</p>

  <p>Reflecting on his trip to the two Asian democracies, Biden said, “What
    struck me was these kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in
    the world.”</p>
  <p>“Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage?” he asked.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The president, who lost one of his children in a car accident and another
    to cancer, expressed condolences to Uvalde parents who, he said, “will never
    see their child again, never have them jump in bed and cuddle with
    them.”</p>
  <p>The anniversary of the death of Biden’s son Beau, who was 46 when he
    succumbed to brain cancer in 2015, is on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With gun-control legislation stalled on Capitol Hill, the president has
    little to offer but yet another call to action and grief for the victims’
    families. Biden didn’t call for specific measures but said that when the US
    had an assault-weapons ban in place, from 1994 to 2004, mass shootings
    declined, and then “tripled” after the law expired.</p>
  <p>“Don’t tell me we can’t have an impact on this carnage,” Biden said.</p>
  <p>Democrats have repeatedly tried and failed to enact new gun-control
    measures -- including universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban
    -- in the decade since Sandy Hook. Multiple proposals have been blocked by
    Republicans and a handful of centrist Democrats.</p>

  <p>“It would be very difficult,” he said Tuesday. “You’re talking about
    millions of people out there, and there have got to be some screwballs that
    are just totally unpredictable. And there’s no way to identify who they are.
    So none that I can think of.”</p>
  <p>Legislation expanding gun background checks to sales at gun shows and
    online cleared the Democrat-led House in March of last year on a 227-203
    vote and a second bill cleared, 219-210. That bill would prevent gun sales
    from proceeding if a background check isn’t completed within three days as
    allowed under current law.</p>
  <p>But in the 50-50 Senate, where at least 10 Republican votes are needed to
    muscle past a filibuster, both measures stalled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer moved late Tuesday to put two gun
    background-check bills on the Senate calendar, teeing up potential floor
    votes.</p>
  <p>(Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for universal background checks
    and gun-safety measures, is backed by Michael Bloomberg, founder and
    majority owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP.)</p>
